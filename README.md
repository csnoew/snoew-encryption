### Download
This program requires [Python 3.10.2](ttps://www.python.org/downloads/){:target="_blank"} or newer to be installed. The source code can be viewed at the [Github Repository](https://github.com/csnoew/snoew-encryption/){:target ="_blank"} where you can also install the program.

### Adding your own letters to the encryptor
The program is compatible with every letter in the latin alphabet, as well as all the numbers. Every letter can automatically be encrypted, but if you are decrypting a message with an unsupported letter the program will crash, you can add a letter by going to the *snoew decryptor.py* where you will add the letters to the string named *alphabet* on line 23:
```markdown
alphabet: str = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzæøå1234567890,.-<>_?!#¤%&/()=+*^~¨´`|}][{$£@½§\:;' "
```
Make sure to keep the space at the end of the string, as it is also considered a character.
